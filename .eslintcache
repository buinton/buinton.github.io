We worked to design a scanner based\n        on laser deflection sensing and over the course of a year we designed and built\n        a prototype of the design. To generate points we need to combine the location\n        of the sensor with the distance the sensor reads. We used an arm to locate the sensor we used\n        CAD and Python to design the arm with fully solved forward kinematics and real time preview.\n        For the the sensor we used laser deflection and computer vision to calculate the distance to the wall.\n\n\n        </p>\n\n        <img src=\"arm1.png\" alt=\"Wide angle of the project\" style={{width: \"50%\"}}/>\n\n        <hr/>\n        <h2> 21st Century Skills </h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li> Inquiry-Based Learning\n            <ul>\n              <li> When we started this project we defined what our design criteria was based on existing products and our own desires </li>\n              <li> Keep Materials Inexpensive </li>\n              <li> Accurate Dimensional Proportions </li>\n              <li> Easy to Use for Consumers </li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li> Creative Problem-Solving </li>\n            <p> We extensively used CAD models and plain old pen and paper to plan out our project </p>\n            <img src=\"CAD.png\" alt=\"cad drawing of end effector\" style={{width: \"25%\"}}/>\n            <img src=\"drawing.png\" alt=\"paper with some math\" style={{width: \"35%\"}}/>\n          <li> Experimentation </li>\n            <p> We had to experiment to determine which approach we were going to use between Photogrammetry and Laser Deflection.

Through these courses I had my fisrt introduction to robotics at a larger scale that kindled into my passion for robotics today. I decided to learn more about game design because gaming is one of my hobbies and I found it very interesting to learn the inner workings of games and how they work and why developers make the choices they do. My favorite class that I have taken so far is Metals 1, before I had no idea really anything about metal working, but now I have some of the basic skills. However, my time in the class was cut short, but I am looking forward to working more with metal in the future.\n        </p>\n        <h2>\n        21st Century Skills\n        </h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li> Inquiry-Based Learning </li>\n          <li> Experimentation </li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nclass Contact extends React.Component {\n  renderWork(){\n\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"contentBox\">\n        <h1> Lets get in touch </h1>\n        <hr/>\n        <h2> Send me an email </h2>\n        <h2> <b> quinnvoronin(at)gmail.com </b> </h2>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n\n}\n\nclass Work extends React.Component {\n  renderWork(){\n\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <h1> Work </h1>\n    )\n  }\n\n}\n\nclass Projects extends React.Component {\n  renderProject(content) {\n\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"projects\">\n        {this.renderProject({header: \"boys.png\", title: \"My Latin Skills\", body: \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ex augue percipit vix.
